## Vision (image of the future)

The Canadian Experience is real when the federal government leverages modern technologies to interact seamlessly with Canadians through digital infrastructure.



## Mission (team's reason for existence)

Be the initiator of change within IITB to lay the path for the evolution of ESDC's digital services.

This will be done through an open collaborative approach that will further ESDC's mandate in the digital era by aligning IITB with the Government of Canada's Digital Standards and Treasury Board's Policy on Service and Digital.
